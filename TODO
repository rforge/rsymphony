* SYMPHONY customizations
  feature request send by <amberti@inwind.it>:
  I found that use of Symphony in R could be very useful, actual version
  of Rsymphony miss a lot in terms of customization, I'd like to ask
   you implementation of command below (in order of importance): 

  - find_first_feasible
  - time_limit
  - node_limit
  - gap_limit
  - different cuts in general
  - all other commands
